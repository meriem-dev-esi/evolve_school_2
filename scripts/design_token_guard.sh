# Keeps raw colours out of the markup.
#
# The tokens in app/globals.css only stay useful if new code uses them. A linter
# cannot express "#84cc16 should have been text-brand", so this greps for the
# specific shapes that have a token.
#
# The rule earns its keep from a real incident: the previous site had the brand
# lime written as a literal in eleven files, and changing it meant finding all
# eleven. With tokens, a rebrand is a one-file diff.
#
# It is intentionally narrow — it flags hex colours and arbitrary-value colour
# classes, not every number in the codebase. A guard that cries wolf gets
# switched off, and then it protects nothing. If it blocks you and the rule is
# wrong, change the rule in the same pull request and say why in the PR body.
# Do not add a quiet exemption.
